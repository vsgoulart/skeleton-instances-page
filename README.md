To install and run just execute `yarn` and then `yarn start`. Both the frontend and mock backend servers are going to
start.

## Expectations

- Instances List API request: the query URL should be ok, no need to return filtered instances
- When changing the filter or applying operations, the statistics endpoint and instances endpoints should be called
- Polling Operations and Instances Table should work, correct state need to be shown

## Comparison criteria

- Easy to implement? (learning curve)
- Maintainability on more complex state
- Code readability
- Library documentation
- Active support/community
- Performance
- Testability
